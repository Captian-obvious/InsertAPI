<h1>InsertAPI</h1>
<p>
    The Insert Cloud API is a versitile and dynamic system for loading any uncopylocked / public model from the roblox marketplace.<br>
    The API is based on Robuyasu's Insert Cloud and instead of using Golang it uses python and a custom loading system.<br>
    In fact it can even load unions properly which Robuyasu's could not. To accomplish this it uses a python script to extract the union data into a Set of Parts in a custom property called 'Parts' which allows the game to create the parts that make up the union and then<br>
    Using UnionAsync the game can recreate the unions in the file.
