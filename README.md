<h1>InsertAPI</h1>
<p>
    The Insert Cloud API is a versitile and dynamic system for loading any uncopylocked / public model from the roblox marketplace.<br>
    The API is based on Robuyasu's Insert Cloud and instead of using Golang it uses python and a custom loading system.<br>
    In fact it can even load unions properly which Robuyasu's could not.<br>
